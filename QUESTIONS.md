Short answer questions

**1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next stepin your career?**

   I am looking for a team that is focused on the quality of their software, and I know that at LawnStarter there would be many opportunities to learn and teach. In addition, the stack you work with caught my attention, as well as the principles of how the code should be written.

**2. What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?**

   How you work with testing and CI/CD, this is fundamental for me, since I have already worked on projects without automated tests, I know how this can compromise the future of the application.

**3. Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production?**

   Yes, I have been working in an environment like this for about 5 years, and for me, as long as the tests ensure that nothing is broken, and all new features have been implemented with feature flags to be removed when necessary, I don't believe this is a problem; on the contrary.

**4. What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?**

   Definitely Laravel, it had been a long time since I worked with PHP, and having to learn Laravel to do this test was quite challenging, it seems to be a robust programming language, I will continue to improve my skills in it from now on.

**1. What parts of this did you enjoy?**

   I found it a good challenge overall; the front end was challenging in trying to follow the Figma design as closely as possible, and the database part was a good technical challenge. Even without much experience in the language, I was able to solve it.

**2. What parts of this did you dislike?**

   Setting up Datadog was complicated, but it wasn't part of the challenge; it was something I tried to do on my own because it was in the job description.
